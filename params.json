It also comes with Brill.css and themes.css.\r\nThe css files are still under progress, so don't use them. To install it with npm, write npm install brill.js\r\n\r\nHow to use it\r\n============\r\n\r\n\r\nTo start using it, make a variable called app (or whatever you want). Inside app, write this: <code>new Brill([]);</code>\r\nYou can put anything you want in that array. It will just get returned.To make a get request(please say if this doesn't work) write <code>app.get(\"/path\",callback());</code> It should work. The code is in brill.js. Make a pull request if you have any improvements.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn v1, there is a number of functions. To use the map function, simply write <code>app.map(callback);</code> You really should look in the library.\r\n\r\nIf you have any ideas or improvements, please comment or make a pull request.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
